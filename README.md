# MEAN-Stack-App
This is a practical example of a MEAN Stack (Mongo, Express, AngularJS and Node.JS) application.


This app was created by me for learning purposes and uses json files and some APIs to display Flights information.

The user can look for Flight Companies and see the actual routes each company has.

I used:
- Node.JS + Express for the Backend
- AngularJS, HTML 5, CSS 3 and Bootstrap for the Frontend
- MondoDB, JSON and APIs for data
